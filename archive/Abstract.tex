{\noindent{\Large Abstract} }\\
\par Sentiment analysis has been the technique used to mine opinions from customer reviews. The classical approach to this was to treat an entire sentence as a document and extract sentiments ("positive", "neutral", and "negative") based on the all words. However, it has apparent limits for sentences that contain more than one aspect with conflicting sentiments. An example for this would be a review for a restaurant that says, "The food was tasty, but I donâ€™t think it came at a reasonable price". The sentence contains two aspects (the one on quality of food and another on the price of the menu), and two contradicting sentiments. Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) addresses this issue by classifying sentiments for a given aspect label. In this approach, the previous example would have two different sentiments for both aspects would be correctly reflected.

\par ABSA has its own issue that it analyzes each sentence in a review independently, not taking into account the argumentative structure of the review. In our research we explore simple classical algorithms such as the SVM and explore its accuracy within the English dataset provided by SemEval 2016. We have also implemented neural network models, i.e. LSTM and GRU. Both of the models are compared and analyzed in terms of their accuracy measure.
We will compare the performance of our model with the work "A Hierarchical Model of Reviews for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis" \cite{T1-P2}. The paper considers datasets of customer reviews in 5 domains and 8 languages, with a total of 11 domain-language datasets. Given the time frame and our objective, focus will be placed on only the English datasets, which consist of two domains, restuarants (REST) and laptops (LAPT). \\
